# GaiaComCoin – Governance Policy

Version 1.0

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the governance principles and decision-making framework of the GaiaComCoin protocol.

Governance is designed to ensure:

* Transparency
* Decentralized participation
* Protection of ethical and humanitarian principles
* Long-term protocol stability

---

## 2. Governance Scope

Governance applies to:

* Allocation and use of the Humans Wallet
* Protocol upgrades affecting governance or tokenomics
* Voting mechanisms embedded in the protocol

Core cryptographic, networking, and consensus logic are not subject to discretionary governance changes unless explicitly defined in protocol upgrade proposals.

---

## 3. Humans Wallet

A fixed portion of the total supply is allocated to the Humans Wallet.

Characteristics:

* Fully on-chain governed
* Subject to voting mechanisms defined in the protocol
* Funds may only be released following successful governance approval

All disbursements must be:

* Verifiable on-chain
* Linked to transparent documentation (e.g. IPFS hashes)

---

## 4. Proposal Process

1. Proposal submission with verifiable documentation
2. Minimum stake requirement to prevent spam
3. Voting period defined by protocol parameters
4. Approval threshold: >51% of participating stake
5. Automatic execution upon successful validation

---

## 5. Limitations

Governance decisions:

* Cannot override cryptographic security guarantees
* Cannot modify maximum supply
* Cannot remove or bypass vesting rules

These constraints are enforced at the protocol level.

---

## 6. Disclaimer

This governance system is experimental.

Participation in governance does not create:

* Fiduciary duties
* Legal partnerships
* Liability for contributors or maintainers

All participants act voluntarily and at their own risk.
