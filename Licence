# GAIA COM COIN – LICENSE PROTOCOL

Version 1.0
Copyright © VisionGaiaTechnology

---

## 1. Overview

This repository uses a **multi-license structure** to balance:

* Open-source collaboration
* Security, auditability, and trust
* Protection of governance, tokenomics, and ethical foundations

Different parts of the codebase are licensed under different licenses, as described below.

This approach is intentional and aligned with best practices for critical protocol infrastructure.
